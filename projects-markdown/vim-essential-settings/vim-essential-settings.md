## Different Types of VIM Text Editor

Duration: 0:05:00


Vim comes in several variants, each catering to different needs and environments:

1. **Vim**: The standard version available on most Unix-based systems. It provides a robust set of features suitable for everyday text editing.

2. **GVim**: The graphical version of Vim, offering menus and toolbars for users who prefer a GUI. It includes all the features of Vim with additional graphical elements.

3. **Neovim**: An extensible and modernized fork of Vim, designed to provide better performance and more advanced features, including improved plugin architecture and asynchronous execution.

4. **MacVim**: A macOS-specific version of Vim, which integrates seamlessly with macOS's look and feel, providing a native experience for Mac users.

5. **Vim in IDEs**: Many IDEs (like VSCode and IntelliJ) offer Vim emulation through plugins, allowing users to leverage Vim keybindings and commands within their preferred development environment.

## Installing VIM 


### Installing VIM on MAC Machines

Since I am a Mac user, I wanted to start setting VIM on Mac Machines


```sh
brew install vim
```

Check if `vim` is installed

```sh
vim --version
```


Check where vim is install 

```sh
which vim
```


### Installing VIM on Linux 

#### Installing VIM on Debian/Ubuntu

#### Installing VIM on Fedora


### Installing VIM on Windows Machines

<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Understanding VIM Modes

Vim operates in different modes, each designed for specific tasks:

1. **Normal Mode**: The default mode for navigating and manipulating text. Use commands to delete, copy, and move text.
2. **Insert Mode**: Enter this mode by pressing `i`. It allows you to insert and edit text.
3. **Visual Mode**: Accessed by pressing `v`. It lets you select and manipulate blocks of text.
4. **Command-Line Mode**: Enter this mode by pressing `:`. It is used for executing commands like saving (`:w`), quitting (`:q`), and searching.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Hello VIM 

1. Open VIM: open vim by typing `vim` on your terminal 

2. Exit VIM: Press `esc` key then type `:` and the `q` at the lower left corner of the screen to exit vim editor

## Basic Settings 


### Understanding VIM Essentials

1. **Comments**: 


### Setting Folder Structure


```text
/.vim
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ autoload/                  # Contains scripts that define functions loaded automatically as needed.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup/                    # Stores backup files created during editing sessions.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ colors/                    # Holds color scheme files to customize Vim's appearance.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plugged/                   # Manages Vim plugins and their files, typically used with a plugin manager.
```


Here is example of an already configured VIM

```text
.vim/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ autoload/                  # Contains scripts that are loaded automatically when needed.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <plugin_name>.vim      # Example files that define functions to be autoloaded.
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backup/                    # Stores backup files for edited files.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <backup_file>.vim      # Example backup files created during editing.
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ colors/                    # Contains color scheme files for Vim.
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <color_scheme>.vim     # Example color scheme files to customize Vim's appearance.
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ plugged/                   # Holds Vim plugins managed by a plugin manager (e.g., vim-plug).
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <plugin_name>/         # Directory for each plugin with its own files.
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <plugin_files>.vim
```

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Essentials Settings


Personally I prefer to comment my code as well as configuration file, so whenever I get back to them later, or I change to a different machie, I won't need to look up a command again. 

1. Commenting Lines in VIM: The `"` is the comment character in VIM scripting language

2. Creating Banners to separate different setting sections

for example: The general setting will look more like this:

```text
" ========================================================
"			General Settings
" ========================================================


" ========================================================
"			Plugins Settings
" ========================================================


" ========================================================
"			Other Section Setting
" ========================================================
```

## Essential Commands


<!-- ------------------------ -->

## Installing Vim Plurgins

1. First you need to install Vim-plug, to do so run the following command:


```sh
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

2. Edit `.vimrc` vim config file: Open your .vimrc file in Vim:

```sh
vim ~/.vimrc
```

3. Add vim-plug Initialization: Add the following lines to your `.vimrc` to initialize vim-plug and specify the plugins you want to install:

```vim
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')

" List the plugins you want to install

" Example plugin
Plug 'tpope/vim-sensible'

" Add other plugins here

" Initialize plugin system
call plug#end()
```

4. Install Plugins: Open Vim and run the following command to install the plugins specified in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
:PlugInstall
```
